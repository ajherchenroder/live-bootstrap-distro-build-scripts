# live-bootstrap-distro-build-scripts
This is my repository for storing distro build scripts to be built in the live bootstrap environment. They are intended to be built under the environment built from the following repository:

https://github.com/ajherchenroder/live-bootstrap-with-lfs

The intent of these scripts is to build install media for the distro in question in a live-bootstrap environment built from source. Then the distro can be installed as normal using their internal tool set.
